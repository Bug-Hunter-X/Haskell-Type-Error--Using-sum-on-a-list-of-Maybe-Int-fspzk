This repository demonstrates a common Haskell error related to using the `sum` function with a list containing `Maybe` values. The `bug.hs` file showcases the problematic code that causes a type error. The solution, in `bugSolution.hs`, illustrates how to properly handle the `Maybe` values before applying the `sum` function.  The solution uses `maybe` to handle the potential absence of a value and sums only the `Just` values.  This example highlights the importance of handling potential type errors in Haskell through explicit type management.
